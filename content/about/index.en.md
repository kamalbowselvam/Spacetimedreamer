## Work Experience

### Lead Data Scientist / Software Engineer - Orange (OB), Toulouse, France.

- Led a team of 4 data scientists, 2 data analysts, and 3 software engineers in the thorough development of intelligent applications, validation of models and algorithms prior to production rollout, optimizing performance and reliability.
- Architected and integrated APIs for anomaly detection model to pinpoint network latency issues; Identification of slow devices, reducing intervention time by 93% from 30 minutes to 2.
- Designed and implemented a CI pipeline to test and evaluate computer vision models within the team, resulting in a 50% reduction in model development time.
- Led the development and execution of time series models, including LSTM and Prophet, to optimize capacity planning for client sites; identified sites consuming 90% of network bandwidth, leading to active resource management.
- Drove the team to develop a proof-of-concept application for SNCF enabling tracking and masking of human targets, leveraging 2 deep learning models and Kalman filter.
- Collaborated in Large Language Models distillation tests to reduce carbon footprint and usage cost, aiming to optimize operational efficiency while maintaining peak performance.
- Currently implementing the data access layer for a vector database intended to store 25 million tickets for a RAG application.
- Delved into research of AI advancements and vector databases through biweekly sessions, within the Orange Expert community for Data Science and AI, contributing to knowledge sharing and collaboration.
- Mentored an intern and an apprentice in the fields of unsupervised clustering and data anonymization. Providing precise guidance, technical advice, and practical to foster professional development in these specialized areas.

### Data Scientist / Software Engineer - Expleo Group, Toulouse, France.

- Developed a multi-threaded image processing application for AIRBUS to speed up data delivery.
- Architected and deployed a 3D data synchronization and visualization tool for AIRBUS-BLADE research team that facilitated easy data interpretation and ML model implementation, optimizing the data pipeline.
- Developed a semi-supervised learning application for detecting anomalies in acoustic signals from spectrograms for AIRBUS.
